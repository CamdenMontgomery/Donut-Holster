# Donut Holster

*What was originally a gag gift that only existed in concept is now a real, functional creation.*

**Designed and built by Camden Montgomery**

## Introduction

In 2021, I received a product box titled the Donut Holster. The hilarious box art set high expectations, but inside, there was only a cutout of my friend’s face — the product didn’t exist. The gift was in the joke and the packaging.

The following year, I wanted to give that same friend a truly memorable gift. Now owning a 3D printer, I decided to bring this fictional product to life. After designing, printing, sanding, painting, and assembling, the Donut Holster was real. Its elongated shaft can hold real donuts, although I **only ever stacked donuts on it once** due to the risk of contamination. Proper care and food-safe procedures must be followed if using it for edible items (see [Food Safety Disclaimer](#safety--food-contact-disclaimer)).

The final product features an adjustable nylon strap with a plastic clip, allowing the wearer to attach and display it. It combines functionality with the humor and style of the original concept.

## How I Made It

The entire design was created in **Blender**. It consists of 5 functional 3D-printed parts, plus 2 stencil parts used for applying text (which are discarded after use). The printed components are:

* Main body
* Cylindrical rod holder
* Long rod for holding donuts
* Rod stabilizer ring
* End cap for the rod

Printing and assembly involved careful attention to detail to ensure proper fit and finish.

## Assembly Instructions

1. **Print all parts** at the recommended settings (see Print Settings & Estimates). Ensure the stencils are printed if you plan to add text.
2. **Prepare surfaces:** Sand each part starting with coarse grit, progressing to finer grits, until surfaces are smooth and edges are clean.
3. **Painting:** Apply primer spray to each part, allow to dry fully. Then paint with blue and white glossy sprays according to your design plan. Allow paint to cure between coats.
4. **Seal:** Once paint is fully dry, coat each part with a **food-safe polyurethane or other certified food-safe coating**. This adds durability and can prepare the surfaces for limited food contact.
5. **Prepare the nylon strap:** Measure and cut the strap to length. Use a lighter to carefully curl the ends to prevent fraying and aid in inserting into clips.
6. **Assemble strap and clip:** Insert the nylon strap into the 3-prong plastic clip. Secure with super glue if necessary. Ensure the strap slides freely and holds securely when clipped.
7. **Insert rod into holder:** Place the long rod into the cylindrical rod holder on the main body. Stabilize it using the ring and attach the end cap. Make sure all parts fit snugly and rotate or slide only as intended.
8. **Apply text (optional):** Position the stencil parts on the main body, paint over them, and carefully remove stencils once paint is dry.
9. **Final check:** Confirm all parts are secure, the strap is adjustable, and the rod holds donuts without wobbling. Make any minor adjustments as needed.

Following these steps carefully ensures a polished, functional Donut Holster.

## Safety & Food Contact Disclaimer

3D-printed parts, including those made from PLA, are **not inherently food-safe** due to their porous nature, which can trap bacteria. While PLA is biodegradable and non-toxic, the surface texture of FDM prints can harbor contaminants, making them unsuitable for direct and repeated food contact.

Applying a **polyurethane spray** does **not automatically make a 3D-printed item food-safe**. Standard polyurethane coatings are intended for wood and other surfaces, not for repeated food contact. To ensure food safety, a **coating specifically approved for food contact** is required.

For detailed guidance on making 3D-printed parts safe for food contact, see this [3D Printing for Food Contact Guide](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/3-d-printed-parts-for-food-contact.html).

**Important:** I am not a professional in food safety. Following these instructions does **not guarantee** the product is safe for consumption. Handle with caution, and do not assume liability for any misuse.
